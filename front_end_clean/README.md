## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account
- Stripe account (for payments)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-app.git
   cd e-commerce-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Functions
   - Copy your Firebase config to `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js`

4. **Set up Stripe**
   - Create a Stripe account at [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
   - Get your publishable and secret keys
   - Add them to your environment variables

5. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
